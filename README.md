# lx2160_build_kernelupdate
A simple kernel build script on SolidRun lx2160, based on patches from SolidRun https://github.com/SolidRun/lx2160a_build

Just run the shell script and you will get a ready-made core with headers and other necessary things.
You can configure the kernel through the config menu after the first completion of the kernel build
In the build/linux directory, run the #make menuconfig.
